# Particle Swarm Optimization Acceleration Challenge Repository

Welcome to the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Acceleration Challenge repository! This repository contains all the code and documentation developed in response to the challenge described below.

## Challenge Description

The objective of this challenge is to accelerate the PSO algorithm using a 5-stage teaching processor based on the RISC-V architecture. Participants are tasked with implementing custom instructions and modifying the hardware using Codasip Studio to enhance the PSO algorithm's performance.

## Repository Contents

1. **`code/`**: This directory contains the source code for custom instructions and hardware modifications.

2. **`report/`**: Inside this directory, you'll find the comprehensive report documenting the design process, performance analysis, and lessons learned.

3. **`presentation/`**: This directory includes materials for the final presentation summarizing the findings and outcomes.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pso-acceleration-challenge.git
   ```

2. **Review Resources**:
